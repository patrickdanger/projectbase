			If you're seeing this, the projectbase webserver is working.
			Get rid of this index.html file and get coding.
		</h3>
		<p>
			<em>Remember:</em> the projectbase webserver automatically 
			resolves the paths for different file types, so while regular
			html goes in the webroot directory jade, stylus and coffee
			source is dropped right into the src directory and compiled
			out dynamically on request.
