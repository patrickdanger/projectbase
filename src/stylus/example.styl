/*
	example.styl
	
	included as part of the projectbase repo to show how stylus templates
	can be easily dropped into (or created within) the src/stylus directory
	become immediately available to the included webserver

	if you're running the webserver included in projectbase, simply point
	your browser at http://localhost:8080/example.styl to see how the 
	server will compile and serve this stylus template.

	if you want to learn more about stylus and what makes it so awesome
	as node-based alternative to sass, head over to their site and 
	read up on the features:
